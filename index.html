		<h3>Rasputin</h3>
			<p>Source:</p>
			<a href="https://github.com/Sturmkrieg/rasputin" alt="Source code on GitHub">https://github.com/Sturmkrieg/rasputin</a>
			<p>Rasputin is a very basic webshell tool that can be used for gaining shell command
			access in enviornments where shell access is not normally possible, or as a penetration
			testing tool.  If used in a production enviornment (any live webserver that is accessible
			on the internet), extreme care should be taken so that it is not exploited by malicious
			hackers.  Any malicious misuse of the webshell could have very serious effects on the
			website and server on which the webshell is running, as well as any users who have
			registered on the website(s).  For example, malicious use could result in user passwords
			being discovered and users being hacked on many different web services.  Any users of this
			webshell should make sure that they use a very long and secure password.  Changing the
			login username to something that is not obvious is very strongly recommended.  Anything
			such as "admin," "tester," or "user" is extremely insecure and means that an attacker
			will only have to guess the password and not the username in addition.</p>

			<p>To install Rasputin, upload the files containing the scripts and pages to any folder
			on the webserver where you would like to access it from.  Before doing anything else,
			edit the sysConfig.php file and change the username and password that will be used for
			logging into the webshell.  The password is hashed in order to prevent someone with access
			to the script from knowing the password, so you will need to enter the hashed value of
			the password.  You must make sure that you change the password because the default value
			for the password is "root," which is useful for development enviornments where only the
			administrator or programmer has access.  You can use <a href="https://gist.github.com/Inquisitor-Sasha/8763418">this script</a>
			to generate the hashed value of the password.  The script is run from the command line.</p>

		<h3>WikiBanner</h3>
			<p>Source:</p>
			<a href="https://github.com/Sturmkrieg/mw-WikiBanner" alt="Source code on GitHub">https://github.com/Sturmkrieg/mw-WikiBanner</a>
			<p>WikiBanner is a MediaWiki extension that allows sysadmins to create a banner that
			displays on the wiki, from the server in LocalSettings.php.  The advantage of configuring
			the banner from the server is that only system administrators will have access to the
			banner code, and so any HTML and JavaScript can be used to create the banner without the
			risk of malicious code being entered.  The downside of the configuration is that web users
			on the wiki will not be able to configure the banner.  Future versions of this extension might
			include an option to allow the banner code to be defined in a MediaWiki system message page
			from the wiki on the web, so that end users of the wiki with the proper permissions will be
			able to configure the banner.  The extension allows for two banners to be create, one at the
			top of the page and another at the bottom.</p>

<p>Attention nerd girls!</p>
<p>Do not date the nice guy: a guide to identifying the closet misogynists</p>
	<br/>
	<br/>
<p>You might already be familiar with terms like the "friendzone" and "nice guy."  If you're reading this, you probably don't know exactly how manipulative and misogynistic niceguys are and how their friendzone construct doesn't actually exist and is nothing more than their misogynistic garbage for the state of being that they enter when a girl refuses to be a sex vending machine for them.  That point is important.  The friendzone does not exist and is a misogynistic construct.  Niceguys claim that girls banish them to the friendzone by refusing to date or have sex with them even after they have been extremely nice to them.  The reality is that niceguys are not nice to girls; they come across as desperate, manipulative, and creepy.  They often spend large amounts of money on dates or gifts and do favors in order to impress girls.  This is all extremely manipulative behavior.  Niceguys approach girls the way that most people would approach a vending machine; they expect that they will spend large amounts of money on their desired girl, and that she will drop sex as a reward.  When this fails, they begin their path toward open misogyny.</p>
<p>At first when niceguys are reject for sex or a date, depending on how far they got, they claim that they have been "friendzoned" by an inconsiderate girl who does not respect all of their favors and niceness.
